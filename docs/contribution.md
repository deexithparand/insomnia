### Setup and Installation

To install and set up Insomnia, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docsify for Documentation**:
   Docsify will be used to serve documentation. To install Docsify globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g docsify-cli
   ```

2. **Run Docsify Local Server**:
   To view the documentation locally:
   ```bash
   docsify serve ./docs
   ```

   This will serve the documentation at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Docker Setup**:
   You can use Docker to set up the application. The `docker-compose.yml` file and `Dockerfile` will help you build and run the application in a containerized environment. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up Docker for the project.

4. **Database Setup**:
   - The initial database schema is defined in `migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`.
   - Run the migration script (`scripts/migration.sh`) to set up the database.
