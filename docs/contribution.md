## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

### Root Directory
- **`main.go`**: The entry point for the CLI application.
- **`go.mod`**: Dependency management file for Go modules.
- **`go.sum`**: Checksums for the project's dependencies.

---

### Key Directories

#### 1. **`cmd/`**
This folder contains the command definitions for the CLI. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific feature or resource.

- **`root.go`**: Defines the base/root command for the CLI.
- **`workspace/`**: Commands related to workspaces.
  - **`workspace.go`**: The parent command for managing workspaces.
  - **`list.go`**: Subcommand to list all workspaces.
  - **`create.go`**: Subcommand to create a new workspace.
  - **`connect.go`**: Subcommand to connect to a workspace.
  - **`delete.go`**: Subcommand to delete a workspace.
- **`endpoint/`**: Commands related to endpoints.
  - **`endpoint.go`**: The parent command for managing endpoints.
  - **`list.go`**: Subcommand to list all endpoints.
  - **`create.go`**: Subcommand to create a new endpoint.
  - **`delete.go`**: Subcommand to delete an endpoint.

---

#### 2. **`config/`**
Manages the configuration utilities for the CLI.

- **`config.go`**: Handles CLI state, such as the current active workspace.

---

#### 3. **`database/`**
Contains all database-related logic.

- **`models.go`**: Defines the GORM models, such as `Workspace` and `Endpoint`.
- **`migrations/`**: Stores database migration files.
- **`seed.go`**: Contains logic for seeding initial data into the database.

---

#### 4. **`utils/`**
Optional utilities to keep the codebase clean and reusable.

- **`printer.go`**: Common functions for output formatting and printing to the terminal.

## Coding Guidelines

1. **Write Clean Code**  
   Follow Go's best practices and conventions.
   
2. **Keep Commands Modular**  
   Each command should focus on a single responsibility.

3. **Database Models**  
   Ensure all models are defined in `database/models.go` and linked to migrations.

4. **Document Your Code**  
   Add comments for functions and complex logic.

5. **Testing**  
   Test commands and database functionality before submitting.
